					<aside class="notes">
					Any conversation about security should start with threat modeling.
					It can be a [*] scary-sounding term, but at it's simplest, it's just:
					- [*] Figuring out what you're afraid of, and...
					- [*] Choosing your security tools and techniques based on that threat.

							There's an organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation (around since 1990) which describes itself as a "nonprofit organization defending civil liberties in the digital world."
							In the past few years, they created a Surveillance Self-Defense guide which contains a lot of the information I'm going to share with you today.
							I encourage you to go home tonight and take some time to look through the resources in their guide, because they will provide much more detail than I'm able to fit into this presentation.

						If this doesn't sound like a rough description of you, then you probably have a different threat model, and this presentation isn't exactly for you.
						<br>[*] I'll try to point out places where your needs might differ and where you should look into different tools and techniques.
						<br>[*] Please talk to me after to discuss how you can figure out your own specific needs.

							Use strong passwords<br>
							just as important, Never reuse passwords<br>
							If you reuse a username and password, then if one site is hacked and their database of user accounts is stolen, then whoever has that information can immediately log in as you on any other website where you used the same password.<br>
							https://haveibeenpwned.com currently tracks 187 hacked websites totalling over 2 billion usernames and passwords (myspace, linkedin, adobe...)

						<aside class="notes">
							Two-factor authentication is a system that adds a second <em>factor</em> to the process of logging into a website.<br>
							The first factor is something you know, your password... but this doesn't change often and can be intercepted and used by someone else. (or you could have reused passwords and had anopther site's database hacked)<br>
							The second factor is something you have, which is much more difficult to steal over the internet....

								<li> Two-factor authentication
								<li> Enable it everywhere you can (Use 2FA wherever available)
								<li> Prefer tokens instead of SMS
								<li> Your email account isz the master key to your digital life

					<aside class="notes">
						What we've discussed so far is mostly about protecting yourself from remote attacks over the internet, but it's important to also secure your devices against physical access.<br>
						Password on computer, and passcode on your phone<br>
						A strong phone passcode should be at least six digits (not the four that may still be the default)<br>
						TouchID is good for convenience, but you can be forced to use your finger to unlock your phone<br>
						Lick your finger<br>
						Encrypot your devices: on by default on iphones, easy to turn on on an android phone and a mac, available on a PC<br>
						Just don't forget your password
